My configuration files.

This is the first thing I copy onto a new computer.
I've made an effort to make everything work across Linux, Mac, and Windows, but the shell configs are made with OS X in mind.

The .zshrc requires [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

The .vimrc uses vundle. Install it by running
`git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
vim +PluginInstall +qall`
